# Xilinx Zync-7000 with wideband ADC

According to this [habrahabr article](https://habrahabr.ru/post/323716/) some Zync-7000 series Xilinx chips contain ADC with up to 4GHz sampling frequency. According to [official Xilinx page](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html#productTable) Z-7015 indeed have ADC. [This board](https://products.avnet.com/shop/en/ema/kits-and-tools/development-kits/aes-z7pz-7z015-som-g-3074457345623469419) seems to contain this chip.
