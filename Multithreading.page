    * Problems with locks
        * No composability
        * Break incapsulation
        * Easy to break by taking lock improperly
    * Modern concurrency
        * Software transaction memory (implemented in Closure and Haskell(imho))
        * Actors (AKA erlang and scala) Seems that Go channels also go along this line
        * Dataflow concurrency
