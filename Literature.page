## Time as money

* [Евгений Лукин, Любовь Лукина Пока не кончилось время](https://fantlab.ru/work5975) Впервые опубликовано в журнале «Горизонт» (Кишинев), 1989, №11 -С.37-40. --This is where I first encountered this idea.

Also Harlan Ellison claimed that the idea of time as money was first coined by him in 'Repent, Harlequin said the ticktockman' (1965)

## Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, linguistic relativity

Apparently there were a rather long epoch when the idea of linguistic relativity and constructing languages for thinking particular thoughts were especially popular. It would be interesting to research genealogy of this idea. Might be that even esperanto is to blame, no confirmation, of course.

    * Delany Babel-17
    
It is interesting to note that Delany book also suggest to edit thoughts with the language. However, the idea of language without word for 'I' was back to Ain Rand. This might be related to Reflections on trusting trust.
