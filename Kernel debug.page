# Netconsole

Since modern notebooks does not have COM or UART ports (or these ports are well hidden) there is a tool that provides quite low level network logging on ethernet interface. 

The main sources of wisdom:

* [Debian: debugging system freeze](https://debian-administration.org/article/492/Debugging_system_freezes)
* [Using netconsole to see kernel messages](http://web.archive.org/web/20080616135606/http://www.coraid.com/support/cln/CLN-HOWTO/ar01s09.html)

## Debugging freezing issue

Create a  file in  ```/etc/modprobe.d/``` containing the following line

```options netconsole netconsole=32769@192.168.1.1/eth1,32769@192.168.1.6/01:23:34:56:78:9A```

Here

* 192.168.1.1 -- desired address of our computer
* eth1 -- ethernet interface
* 32769 -- port (UDP)
* 192.168.1.6 -- address of the logger machine
* 01:23:34:56:78:9A -- mac address of the logging machine or mac address of the router if the logging machine is not in the same network.

Start netconsole with ```modprobe netconsole```. Debian stock kernels have support for this.

## Debugging startup issue

Add the ```netconsole=32769@192.168.1.1/eth1,32769@192.168.1.6/01:23:34:56:78:9A``` line to the kernel command line. I assume that we also need to pack corresponding module into initrd.

# Tracing of syscalls/etc

* [Brendan Gregg: Chosing a linux tracer](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2015-07-08/choosing-a-linux-tracer.html)
    * Ftrace
    * perf-events (linux-tools-common package). Exposed as ```perf``` tool
    * eBPF (in development)
    * SystemTap -- requires compiling modules.
    * LTTng -- out of tree tracer
    * ktap (in development)
    * dtrace4linux -- license incompatibility, slow development
    * Oracle Linux dtrace -- requires oracle linux
    * sysdig
