# Heat of combustion, enthalpy of formation

## Wikipedia references summary

For fuels containing hydrogen there exist lower and higher heat values, the higher corresponds to condensing all water produced in the reaction.

## Nice tutorial article

 [Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O~2~](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333)

### Summary

The main energy reach molecule is O~2~, so the heat value of the fuel mostly depend on how much oxygen the compound can bind rather than on how many bonds the compound has itself. There is also some amount of energy due to H~2~O production since condensing water releases much energy (hydrogen bonds). This is, however, relevant only to higher heat value of compound.

$\Delta_c H^0 = -417 \mathrm{kJ/mol}\,\nu_{0_2}-44 \mathrm{kJ/mol}\, \nu_{H_2 O}$

For a compound with formula $C_c H_h O_o N_n$ we have $\nu_{0_2}=c+h/4-o/2$, $\nu_{H_2 O}=h/2$. The paper than plots the heat of combustion of many fuels with $c>n+o$ and found quite nice fit within few percent.

For [isooctane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,2,4-Trimethylpentane) the formula gives heat of combustion 5608 kJ/mol , the real value is 5460 kJ/mol. For [n-heptane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptane) formula gives 4939 kJ/mol , real value 4825 kJ/mol
