# Heat of combustion, enthalpy of formation

## Wikipedia references summary

For fuels containing hydrogen there exist lower and higher heat values, the higher corresponds to condensing all water produced in the reaction.

[Heat of combustion tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_of_combustion#Heat_of_combustion_tables)

## Nice tutorial article

 [Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O~2~](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333)

### Summary

The main energy reach molecule is O~2~, so the heat value of the fuel mostly depend on how much oxygen the compound can bind rather than on how many bonds the compound has itself. There is also some amount of energy due to H~2~O production since condensing water releases much energy (hydrogen bonds). This is, however, relevant only to higher heat value of compound.

$\Delta_c H^0 = -417 \mathrm{kJ/mol}\,\nu_{0_2}-44 \mathrm{kJ/mol}\, \nu_{H_2 O}$

For a compound with formula $C_c H_h O_o N_n$ we have $\nu_{0_2}=c+h/4-o/2$, $\nu_{H_2 O}=h/2$. The paper than plots the heat of combustion of many fuels with $c>n+o$ and found quite nice fit within few percent.

For [isooctane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,2,4-Trimethylpentane) the formula gives heat of combustion 5608 kJ/mol , the real value is 5460 kJ/mol. For [n-heptane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptane) formula gives 4939 kJ/mol , real value 4825 kJ/mol

# Fischer-Tropsch process

Fischer-Tropsch process for producing liquid petrol suitable for internal combustion engines. Process was developed in Germany in 1925, it became relatively popular in Nazi Germany in 1943/44 when there were shortage of  oil supply. Wikipedia [en](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process) [de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer-Tropsch-Synthese).
The components for the process is $H_2$ and $CO$ gases. According to DE wiki, the typical output is 10-15% propan+butane, 50% car gas (benzine), 28% diesel fuel, 8% parafine.
In the typical setup coal is converted to $H_2$ and $CO$ by reacting it with water steam. If one has a source of $H_2$ (e.g. from water electrolysis), one can try to convert $CO_2$ to $CO$ suitable for the subsequent process. Audi actually managed to do this [Audi is making fuel from air and water](https://qz.com/392138/audi-is-making-fuel-from-air-and-water/) [Fuel of the future: Research facility in Dresden produces first batch of Audi e-diesel](https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/fuel-of-the-future-research-facility-in-dresden-produces-first-batch-of-audi-e-diesel-352)

# pH of solutions

$$pH+pOH=14$$

## Strong bases
For the solutions of strong bases (like KOH, NaOH) all OH$^-$ can be assumed to dissociate. Thus for 0.1mol/l solution (0.1M solution) 

$$pOH=-\log_{10}0.1=1 \to pH=13$$

## Strong acids

Also assumed to fully dissociate

## Weak acids

Let's assume the concentration of acid in solution is $c$, and $\alpha c$ is dissociated. The definition of dissociation constant:

[H$^+$][A$^-$]= $K_a$ [HA] 

$$\alpha^2 c^2 = K_a (1-\alpha) c $$

From which, assuming $(1-\alpha)\simeq 1$

$$[H^+]=\alpha c = \sqrt{K_a c} $$

## Basic salts

* [Example of sodium carbonate](http://him.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200401103) [See also the earlier article](http://him.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200400702)

Elaborating sodium carbonate example

$$[H^+][HCO_3^-] = K_{1a} [H_2CO_3]$$
$$[H^+][CO_3^{2-}]= K_{2a} [HCO_3^-]$$ (*)

We assume that sodium carbonate fully dissociate, thus $[Na^+]=c_{Na_2 CO_3}$. We denote $c_{Na_2 CO_3}$ as $c_s$.
Since there is no carbon dioxide escaping, we assume that only second stage reaction takes place: 

$$ HOH + CO_3^{2-} = OH^- + HCO_3^- $$

We assume that we get almost all $OH^-$ from this reaction. Thus we assume $[OH^-]\simeq [HO_3^-] = \alpha c_s$.
Since $[HCO_3^-]+[CO_3^{2-}]=c_s$ (we assumed $Na_2 CO_3$ to fully dissociate), the concentration  $[CO_3^{2-}]=(1-\alpha)c_s$.

To express $[H^+]$ in (*), note that $[H^+][OH^-]=K_w=10^{-14}$. 


$[H^+][CO_3^{2-}]= K_{2a} [HCO_3^-]$ $\to$ $\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} (1-\alpha) c_s = K_{2a} [OH^-]$ $\to$  $\frac{K_w}{\alpha c_s} (1-\alpha c_s) = K_{2a} \alpha c_s$.

$$\frac{\alpha^2}{1-\alpha} = \frac{K_w}{K_{2a} c_s}$$. 

Assuming $\alpha\ll 1$, we get 

$$ [OH^-] = \alpha c_s = \sqrt{\frac{K_w}{K_{2a}} c_s} $$.

For $H_2 CO_3 $ : $K_{1a}= 4.31\, 10^{-7}$, $K_{2a} = 5.61\, 10^{-11}$

## Buffer solutions

Consider solution of concentration $c_s$ of salt $MeA$ and $c_a$ of weak acid $HA$, where $Me$ is strong base forming metal,  $A^-$ is a residue of weak acid.

General set of equations:

$$ [H^+]+[Me^+]=[OH^-]+[A^-]$$ 
(Charge balance)
$$ [H^+][OH^-]=K_w =10^{-14} $$
$$ [Me^+]=c_s $$
$$ [HA]+[A^-]=c_a+c_s $$
$$ [H^+][A^-]=K_a [HA] $$

Now, assuming that the solution will have acidic reaction we can make simplifying assumption that $[H^+]\gg [OH^-]$, the difference will be at least several order of magnitude. Thus:
$$[H^+]+c_s \simeq [A^-]$$
$$[HA]+[H^+]\simeq c_a$$
$$[H^+]([H^+]+c_s)=K_a(c_a-[H^+])$$

Assuming $$c_s\gg K_a$$ we get $[H^+]=\frac{K_a c_a}{c_s}$.

Summary: 

* Try Trilon B mixture with some alcohol (isopropanol?). Alcohol is for surface tension reduction. Trilon B is frequently used in calc removal powders.
* Try citric acid in mixture with alcohol. Oxalic acid is even better, but it is somewhat poisonous.
* Try zinc mixed with NaOH. The best zinc is in the form of pellets, zinc powder can be flammable.
* Try heating
