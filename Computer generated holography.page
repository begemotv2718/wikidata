It is tempting to make holograms from computer generated code. The early attempts described in my early childhood holography book now should be greatly surpassed (since there is more than 1000-fold increase in computation power). However the sources on CGH are still scarce. Generally speaking this should be solution of wave equation with object models placed into solver.
