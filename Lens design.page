# Open source tools for lens raytracing and lens design

* [OpenRayTrace](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openraytrace/) -- Seems to be frozen, but available
* [defphos](https://code.google.com/archive/p/defphos/source) -- All links are gone
* [opus](http://www.maxreason.com/software/optics/opus.html) -- working project written in [XBasic](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbasic/?source=typ_redirect). Difficult to get running in the tiling window manager, since it uses multiple windows.
