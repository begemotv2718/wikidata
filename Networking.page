# Using card as both AP and wifi.

## Check that it is possible to use more than one interface on wifi.

```bash
iw list
```
look for the section: ```valid interface combinations:```

The result looks like this
```
	valid interface combinations:
		 * #{ managed } <= 1, #{ AP, P2P-client, P2P-GO } <= 1, #{ P2P-device } <= 1,
		   total <= 3, #channels <= 2
```

## Add another interface to wifi card.

```bash
iw phy phy0 interface add wlp3s1 type managed
```

## Setup hostapd

* Install hostapd
* By default hostapd starts with ifupdown interface. I'm happy with this.
* Edit ```/etc/network/interfaces```

```
iface wlp3s1 inet static
   hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
   address xxx
   netmask yyy
```

* Create ```/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf```

```bash
zcat /usr/share/doc/hostapd/examples/hostapd.conf.gz > /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```

```
#Important stuff to change
interface=wlp3s1
driver=nl80211
ssid=<ssid_name>
channel=11
wpa=1 # Maybe even wpa=3
wpa_passphrase=pass_phrase_as_it_is

```


## Add interface to dhcp server 

* Edit ```/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server``` add wlp3s1 interface to the INTERFACES variable (separated by space)
* Add subnet in ```/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf```
