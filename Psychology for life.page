# Talking

* [How To Talk On An Emotional Level](http://www.lovelifesolved.com/how-to-talk-on-an-emotional-level)
    * Start talking on the same emotional level, show vulnerability, deepen conversation
* [Turning small talk into big](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-ways-instantly-turn-small-talk-big-erick-diaz)
    * ~~How's your day~~ -> What is the most surprising thing that happens to you recently
    * ~~What do you do for a living?~~ -> What gets you up in the morning? What are you the most passionate about?
    * ~~How are you holding up~~ (i.e something bad happened) -> What's holding you up? What motivates you to go forward?
    * ~~How was your XXX?~~ (e.g. trip to Birobidzhan) -> What would you do differently if you do XXX again?
    * ~~Are you married?~~ -> Do you think that life partner is over/underrated?
* [The same Eric Diaz as above, Levels of conversation](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/5-levels-depth-measure-deep-deep-conversations)
    * Level 1: Relationships/Family issues Open up, tell a story of your unusual relationship (turning out better/worse than expected, etc). Hypothetical Harry: i.e. what if you live in 80th, what century you most like to live? Nice questions.
    * Level 2: Religion/Insecurities/Embarassing personal stories. Already a minefield. And for me religion seems to be on deeper level.
    * Level 3: 
        * Future (If all the chips fell your way, where will you be living and what will you be doing?-How important is meeting a life partner?-Do you want to one day own a house and/or raise children? Why?-Does the endless amount of possibilities actually frighten you from putting your head down and making a choice?-Is traveling the world an actual pursuit you have or do you just constantly seduce yourself with the thought of it?) 
        * Consciousness (When do you feel most present throughout your day? Do you struggle with clarity in regards to your thoughts? Do you think meditation is beneficial or a bunch of mumbo jumbo? How often do you spend your day thinking about what to think about?) Seems to be weak questions for me, but may be ok.
        * Friendly feedback
    * Level 4: Legacy (What I leave after myself/What I want to be remembered for/What bad things I'm responsible for?) Soul (including what separates us from machines)
    * Level 5: Meaning of life
