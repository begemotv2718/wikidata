I've planned to write several texts on the history of computer periphery. One of them (history of computer monitors, in Belarussian) is already sent to Sveta.
History of keyboards was sent as a letter to Ksusha, however, it seems only the preliminary notes survived, I haven't made a photo.

Now I'm planning to work on the mouse history.
