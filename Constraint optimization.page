# Summary

Here I would like to collect information on various constraint optimization problems. I used to have a research direction on this topic (started from automatic poetry generation toy task).

* [Python constraint optimization solver](http://labix.org/python-constraint#head-ac04c8e8bcd72bda1fb01e8823e60e21d79bf8a3)

* [Rosette](https://emina.github.io/rosette/) -- programming language interface for SMT/SAT solvers. [Talk by creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2kx1aFpT6M). 
     * rule system verification
     * rule system synthesis
     * etc.
     * Initial inspiration: MemSAT, [MIT Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/), Kodkod (efficient solver for alloy?)
