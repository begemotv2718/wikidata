# Summary

Here I would like to collect information on various constraint optimization problems. I used to have a research direction on this topic (started from automatic poetry generation toy task).

* [Python constraint optimization solver](http://labix.org/python-constraint#head-ac04c8e8bcd72bda1fb01e8823e60e21d79bf8a3)

* [Rosette](https://emina.github.io/rosette/) -- programming language interface for SMT/SAT solvers.
