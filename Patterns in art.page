# Designing ornament

## Why I get interest in this?

After experiments with [Laser cutter]() I want to design something like a jewelery box with some form of ornament. Then I tried to get idea how to design ornament. It appears that ornament design is related to some other stuff interesting to me, most notably discrete groups, book of Cristopher Alexander about architecture design patterns, pattern formation (including phylotaxis).

## Ornament in books

Wiki suggests a book of [Owen Jones book Grammar of Ornament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Jones_%28architect%29#The_Grammar_of_Ornament)  as one of the sources for inspiration about designing ornament. It seems that this book directly infuenced Christopher Alexander (Pattern language), which in turn plagued programming.

### Summary of the principles of ornament design (from modern paper [User Driven Two-Dimensional Computer-Generated Ornamentation](http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1204&context=csse_fac)) 

1. `Repetition`: Even a simple geometric mark, when repeated through transla­tion, rotation, or scaling, can serve as the basis of an ornament.
2. `Balance`: The principle of balance requires that asymmetrical visual masses be made of equal “weight” [2].
3. `Conformation to Geometric Constraints`: A careful fitting to boundaries is a hallmark of ornament [6]. In addition, for structural integrity, tangential junction provides a powerful sense of physical support to an ornament.
4. `Growth`: Growth is a means of transporting design into new regions and con­
tinuing patterns. Especially for floral ornament, growth is an essential aspect
of creating organic looking ornament. Additionally, intention provides an­
other avenue for artistic control, expressing growth with external influences
taken into consideration, such as growth toward pre-placed flowers or guid­
ance along a central vine.
5. `Conventionalization`: In ornament, conventionalization is the development of abstractions of natural form. When artists develop a conventionalization, they extract only the essential aspects of form and the result often is stylized and modified to be more aesthetic.




## Ornament and discrete groups

[Wallpaper groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group).

Notably, some software supports creation of pattern based on some wallpaper groups most notably [Inkscape has support for all wallpaper groups](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/Tiles-Symmetries.html).

## Software for ornament generation

This reminded me about [Victoria Babakhina LVEE talk]( https://lvee.org/ru/abstracts/134). The program for creating interesting art ideas -- [Alchemy](http://write.flossmanuals.net/alchemy/alchemy/) (the main site is [here](http://al.chemy.org/)).

## Synthetic morphology

[Synthetic morphology](http://synth-e-techmorph.blogspot.com.by/)
This is related to generative/parametric architecture. I found them by looking for Diffusion limited aggregation on google. Software they use: [Grasshoper 3d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_3D) -- labview like pluging for [Rhinoceros 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_3D) -- proprietary 3d modelling CAD.

## Paul Bourke fractals

* [Page link](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/fracintro/)

Fractals often appears as characteristic patterns in dynamical systems. E.g. famous julia fractal. Some interesting patterns can arise from simple iterative process: Newton-Raphson solver for equations
