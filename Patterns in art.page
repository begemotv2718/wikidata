# Designing ornament

## Why I get interest in this?

After experiments with [Laser cutter]() I want to design something like a jewelery box with some form of ornament. Then I tried to get idea how to design ornament. It appears that ornament design is related to some other stuff interesting to me, most notably discrete groups, book of Cristopher Alexander about architecture design patterns, pattern formation (including phylotaxis).

## Ornament in books

Wiki suggests a book of [Owen Jones book Grammar of Ornament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Jones_%28architect%29#The_Grammar_of_Ornament)  as one of the sources for inspiration about designing ornament.

## Ornament and discrete groups

## Software for ornament generation

This reminded me about [Victoria Babakhina LVEE talk]( https://lvee.org/ru/abstracts/134). The program for creating interesting art ideas -- [Alchemy](http://write.flossmanuals.net/alchemy/alchemy/) (the main site is [here](http://al.chemy.org/)).
