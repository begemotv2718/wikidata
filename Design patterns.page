# Notes

## Observer pattern

Actually, simple publish/subscribe scheme. Very popular in robotic operating systems. 

Одобряэм.

## Composite pattern

Most graphical redactors have grouping operation. Also very good idea for any modular design. 

Одобряэм. 

## Visitor pattern

Not clear for me. Most examples look quite artificial. The useful ones seems to be equivalent to 'fold' of 'traverse' in functional languages.

Bullshit?

## Decorator 

Take object return object with decorator suitable for further decoration. 

Function decorators in Python take function, return function, suitable for further decoration.

Одобряэм.

## Memento

Any construction with undo. Editors, database with rollback. Usually implemented by storing data as a list of transactions?
