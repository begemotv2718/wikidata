# Mapping of different systems of psychological types to each other

* [Big 5 description](https://similarminds.com/sloan.html)

From [Big Five and Myers Briggs Personality Systems Â« Personality Research](https://research.similarminds.com/big-five-and-myers-briggs-personality-systems/22)
```
... The Global 5 elements are Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Orderliness, Accommodation, and Intellect. ...[MBTI has 4 elements and] say close to nothing about the Emotional Stability (i.e. Neuroticism) element. ... Despite the issues, T/F correlates mostly with Accommodation and N/S correlates mostly with Intellect (source).  E/I correlates very strongly with Big Five Extroversion and J/P correlates very strongly with Big Five Orderliness.   So what you have with the Myers-Briggs system is basically a not so perfect Big Five minus Emotional Stability.
