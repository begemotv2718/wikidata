# USB poll principle of operation

## stm32f1

From USB_ISTR_REG we read endpoint (bits 0..3) and direction (bit 4) and some other statuses (ctr -- correct transfer, bit 31).

To distinguish OUT and SETUP transaction (which both has out direction) we read USB_EP_SETUP bit in USB_EP register.

We determine `type` of the transaction

```haskell
type = USB_TRANSACTION_SETUP | USB_TRANSACTION_OUT | USB_TRANSACTION_IN
```

According to endpoint and transaction type we call 

```C
  dev->user_callback_ctr[ep][type]
```

EP0 (control) endpoint has the predefined handlers named `_usbd_control_setup`, `_usbd_control_out`, `_usbd_control_in`.

At least `_usbd_control_setup` and `_usbd_control_out` use `usb_control_dispatch` function. This function dispatch user-provided callbacks for the control requests. The user callbacks are provided with the function 

```C
void usbd_register_control_callback(usbd_device? device, uint8_t type, uint8_t type_mask, (*callback)(usbd_device *dev, ?))
```

Field `type` should match `request->bmRequestType & type_mask` for the corresponding handler to be invoked.

# Class functions setup

Class functions setup happen inside callback which is set up using `usbd_register_set_config_callback(usbd_device *dev, usbd_set_config_callback callback)` function.

These callbacks are called from `usb_standard_set_configuration` function, which is in order called to handle request `USB_REQ_SET_CONFIGURATION` inside `_usbd_standard_request_device`, which is in turn called from `_usbd_standard_request` in case `req->bmRequestType & USB_REQ_TYPE_RECIPIENT == USB_REQ_TYPE_DEVICE`, which is in turn called in `usb_control_dispatch`.
