* [Home page for a tool](https://obsidian.md/)

Closed source but free as a beer mind-mapping and wiki tool (actually allows creation of linked markdown pages, has tool for display them as graph). Written in electron, so available cross-platform. Seems to be a little bit inspired by TheBrain commercial tool, but currently has more features. The structure remains even if the tool will stop to be maintained, because this is plain-text markdown files.
