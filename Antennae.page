# Impedance matching

## Use coax cable for impedance matching

### Transmission line equations

![Transmission line model](/line.png)

$$I_{i+1}-I_i=-C \frac{dV_i}{dt}$$
$$V_{i+1}-V_{i}=-L \frac{dI_i}{dt}$$

Out of this we get

$$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = - \mathcal{L} (-i\omega) I(x)$$
$$ \frac{\partial I}{\partial x} = - \mathcal{C} (-i\omega) V(x)$$

Here $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ are inductivity and capacitance per unit length respectively.

General solution for these equations are $V=V_f e^{i k x}+V_r e^{-i k x}$, $I=I_f e^{i k x}+I_r e^{-i k x}$, with $k=\omega\sqrt{\mathcal{L}\mathcal{C}}$ with the following relation between $V_f$,$I_f$,$V_r$, $I_r$:

$$V_f=\sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{C}}}I_f=Z_0 I_f$$
$$V_r=-\sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{C}}}I_r=-Z_0 I_r$$

The line impedance $Z_0$ is purely real, it is gauged by cable manufacturer (typically 50 $\Omega$ or 75 $\Omega$). The product $c\cdot\sqrt{\mathcal{L}\mathcal{C}}$, where $c$ is speed of light is called line shortening coefficient.


### Impedance matching

The next question is: if we have impedance $Z$ at one end of the line, what we will see on the other end? At the start of the line we will have $V=Z I$, thus $Z_0(I_f-I_r)=Z (I_f+I_r)$. Let's denote $Z/Z_0=\alpha$, then $I_r=\frac{1-\alpha}{1+\alpha}I_f$. At the other end of the line with length $l$ we will have $V'=Z_0 (I_f e^{i k l}-I_r e^{-ikl}$, $I'=I_f e^{i k l} + I_r e^{-ikl}$. Substituting this we will eventually get

$$Z'=\frac{V'}{I'}=Z_0\frac{i \sin kl + \alpha \cos kl}{\cos kl + i \alpha \sin kl }$$

We note that in the special case $kl=\frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $Z'=Z_0^2/Z$. This is widely used as 75^2^/50=112.5, somewhat possible antenna resistance.

# Skin effect in copper 

In antenna calculations the copper layer is usually assumed to be thick, e.g. we assume that copper sheet has two independent sides, for example, also we assume that copper layer shields the e/m field completely. Let's justify this assumption.

It can be shown from Maxwell equations that for wave vector in conductor we have the following expression

$$k^2=\mu_0\epsilon_0\epsilon \omega^2 + i \mu_0 \sigma \omega = \epsilon \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} + i\sigma \mu_0 \omega,$$

where the equation is written in SI system, magnetic constant $\mu$ is assumed to be 1, and $\sigma$ is conductivity. For copper the conductivity $\sigma=5.95 10^7$ Siemens/meter. The second term dominates whenever $\omega \ll \mu_0 \sigma c^2/\epsilon$. For copper this is true up to 10^19^ Hz, which seems to be well above the plasma frequency. Thus the second term dominates, this gives the expression for skin layer thickness

$$\sqrt{\frac{2}{\mu_0\sigma\omega}}$$. 

This gives skin layer depth 65 $\mu$m at 1 MHz, 0.6 mm at 10 kHz, and 6$\mu$m at 100MHz.

## Notes on history and availability of NEC2 code

* [Notes](http://www.nec2.org/nec_hist.txt)

 * The remaining NEC codes in the preface paragraph, NEC3 (allows
buried wires) and NEC4 (improved accuracy for stepped-radius wires and
electrically-small segments, adds end caps and insulated wires, smart
input card-reader, catenary-shaped wires, and improved error detection)
are still Military Critical technology.  That status is under question
and may hopefully disappear eventually.*

## Patchwork antennae

> I would recommend using numerical codes based on method of moments. Since you are dealing with high frequencies, it is better to reduce the computational domain, and method of moments uses surface integral equations. Regarding the arbitrary curves, you don't need to worry too much about that since there are very good meshers available and they would handle most of the geometries. About the specific commerical software you can use:[1] HFSS recent versions have integral equation formulation which is basically Method of moments (MOM)[2] Wipl-D, this is also MOM based, less pricey than HFSS, I think that it includes quad mesher though I am not 100% sure about this[3] If you want to develop your own code excellent start would be book by S. Makarov "Antenna and EM Modeling with Matlab", which comes with a number of interesting examples. There is also a free version of Antenna Toolbox which contains improved codes from the book.For a gentle introduction on numerical electromagnetics I recommend David Davidson "Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering".

# Practical stuff

## Determining antenna impedance using generator and resonance contour

* [Described here](https://www.qrz.ru/schemes/contribute/antenns/ua4hul.phtml)

Idea: connect generator through a resistor to the hf milliampermeter, in parallel to an adjustable contour and antenna. Tune the contour into resonance, then connect antenna and determine the shift of the contour parameters to keep it in resonance. This will give imaginary part of the impedance. Then disconnect antenna and connect adjustable resistor. Get the same amplitude of resonance with the resistor, read the value of the resistor as a real part of the antenna impedance.
