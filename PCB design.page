# Footprint libraries and tools

## Madparts

[Madparts -- programmatic design of footprint](https://madparts.org/footprint.html) -- uses [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) to create parts. No real dependence on javascript, just on python libraries. Supports import/export from eagle and kicad. Does not support gEDA, but author will be happy to contact about this. 

Dependencies:

* python (tested with 2.7)
* numpy (tested with 1.7.1)
* pyside (tested with 1.1.2)
* python-opengl (tested with 3.0.1)
* python-bs4 (beautiful soup) (tested with 4.2.0)
* python-imaging (tested with 1.1.7)

## Kicad footprints with scheme and racket

[Footwork](https://github.com/monostable/footwork) use [Racket programming language](http://racket-lang.org/) (dialect of scheme). Attempts to use [Rosette](https://emina.github.io/rosette/) SMT solver to verify constraints.
