The concept of hypertext is invented by Vannevar Bush around 1950. The concept is much refined in Douglas Engelbart "Augmenting Human Intellect". 
However, Bush was not the first to invent hypertext.


# Predecessors of hypertext

Paul Otlet, a Belgian bibliographer and entrepreneur who, in 1934, laid out a plan for a global network of “electric telescopes” that would allow anyone in the world to access to a vast library of books, articles, photographs, audio recordings, and films.Like Bush, Otlet explored the possibilities of storing data on microfilm and making it searchable, with a web of documents connected via a sophisticated linking system.

# Experimental system without web: hypercards

Very close to original Vannevar Bush scheme. Was developed for early macintosh computers.

Notable sets of hypercards: The Electronic whole earth catalog, Time table of history, Manhole game, Myst game

# Modern systems

* [Arrowsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowsmith_System) Also invented by librarian (although with diverse background). Mentioned in the book Range: How Generalists triumph in a specialized world.
* DevonThink. Mentioned in the book: Johnson. Where good ideas come from. A natural history of innovation.
* Similarity search for arxiv papers, like arxiv sanity preserver. Not sure if it like reaching cross domains.
* [Zettelkasten]() -- concept related to hypertext.
