The concept of hypertext is invented by Vannevar Bush around 1950. The concept is much refined in Douglas Engelbart "Augmenting Human Intellect". 
However, Bush was not the first to invent hypertext.


# Predecessors of hypertext

Paul Otlet, a Belgian bibliographer and entrepreneur who, in 1934, laid out a plan for a global network of “electric telescopes” that would allow anyone in the world to access to a vast library of books, articles, photographs, audio recordings, and films.Like Bush, Otlet explored the possibilities of storing data on microfilm and making it searchable, with a web of documents connected via a sophisticated linking system.
