## Finding out which devicetree is used

* [stackexchange question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/192640/how-do-i-tell-which-device-tree-blob-dtb-file-im-using)

**What I saw**

```bootcmd``` contained ```run fdtdetect```. Apparently, fdtdetect contained ```if $board_name=A335BONE then setenv fdtfile am335x-bone.dtb``` etc. ```printenv board_name``` does the trick.
