# FEnics

Works with finite elements. Most basic solver is for time-independent problems, but easy to extend to time-dependent.

## Working with meshes

Current FEnics has a special component for mesh generation named [mshr](https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/mshr/wiki/Tutorial). This component uses [libcgal](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/packages.html) for mesh generation. I haven't yet tried the latest version of dolfin, which supports all the features of libcgal.
