Well I know what is holography, it was invented by Dennis Gabor, etc. What is interesting here

* Connection to wavelets and QM [Gabor uncertainty principle]()
* [Computer generated holography]() Nice idea since I've watched Applied science on the transferring of holographic stickers to chocolate also [Tech ingridients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTi0tM4yQ8)
* Holographic principle, gravitation etc.
