* [Monoids and finger trees (apfelmus)](http://apfelmus.nfshost.com/articles/monoid-fingertree.html) -- As far as I understand finger tree is an annotated tree where annotation form a monoid.
    * [Incremental regular expressions matching on finger trees](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/01/fast-incremental-regular-expression.html) The idea is to make finite state automaton with a result on substring into monoid. Interesting to compare with: Ukkonen algorithm, Suffix trees
