## Summary

It consist of a network interface (tun0 for example) and a device whose file descriptor is obtained by ioctl to /dev/net/tun (/dev/net/tap). The device can be set to a particular user. The data send to the tun or tap interface appear on the obtained file descriptor and can be manipulated.

* ```ip tuntap add dev tun777 mode tun user luser group lusers```
* openvpn --mktun --dev tun777
