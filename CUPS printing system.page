# Daemon

```/usr/sbin/cupsd``` listens on port 631

# End of pipe

```bash
/usr/lib/cups/backend/*
```

* usb -- typical usb printer

# PPD files

PPD files are automatically generated from ```foomatic-db``` xml database.

The main line in ppd file for non-postscript printer is '*cupsFilter'.

# Filters and sequence of application

## foomatic-rip

```foomatic-rip``` is a universal cups filter which can be used for debugging and spooler-less printing. 

## Conversions

* ```/usr/share/cups/mime/mime.convs```
* ```/usr/share/cups/mime/cupsfilters.convs```

The cups should look to the mime type of the source file, find the mime type accepted by final printer filter in ppd file ( *cupsFilter line) and construct the sequence of filters transforming the initial file into final optimizing the transformation cost.

# Important systems not yet clear

* ```man cups-driverd```
* spooling
* How ppd files work for postscript printers: who read them.
