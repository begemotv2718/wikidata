# Specifying source directories: 

```show directories```
```set directories=```
```directory <path>```

If sources are moved and the part of path is changed
```set substitute-path /foo/bar /mnt/cross```

This is from [here](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html)

# Watching class local variable

* Print variable address ```p &bar```
* Set watchpoint to the address ```watch *<addr of bar>```

# Find if the variable is on heap or stack

```/proc/<pid>/mapping``` or ```info proc mapping```

# Print C++ vector and other containers
