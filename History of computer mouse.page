Computer mouse as an input device was first suggested in the laboratory for augmenting human intellect. Designed it seems by Billy English, conceptually introduced by Douglas Engelbart. The predecessors  of the computer mouse are trackball devices for the radar systems.

Optical mouse was introduced by Microsoft around 1999 (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mouse) ). I have impression that optical flow sensor in the mouse is of direct military origin (just look at these gold plating on the sensor), but there is currently no confirmation.

Open questions:

* Military origin of (Microsoft) optical mouse
* Story about english engineer that invented mouse before Engelbart [Ralph Benjamin (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Benjamin)
* Story about aircraft joysticks that were predecessors of the trackball device
