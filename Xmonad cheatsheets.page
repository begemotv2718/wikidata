# Non-tiling window manager inside Xmonad

* [Stackexchange: running non-tiling in xmonad](http://superuser.com/questions/443655/running-a-non-tiling-window-manager-inside-an-xmonad-tile) Recommend to use xnest
* [Another stackexchange: recommends Xephyr](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/44244/run-a-different-window-manager-in-a-specific-workspace-in-xmonad)
* [This page](http://download.swsoft.com/virtuozzo/virtuozzo4.0/docs/en/lin/VzLinuxUG/11482.htm) discuss startup of window manager. The main nontrivial piece of information here is link to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/Xclients in startup

## Offtopic: Xephyr in general
[This page on ubuntu forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3816948) discuss using Xephyr for X session to ssh (to have every application of remote server in the contained window)

The main interesting piece of truth: 

**execute to start Xephyr**

```bash
Xephyr -ac -screen 1280x1024 -br -reset -terminate 2> /dev/null :2 &
```


**execute on remote server**

```bash
ssh -XfC  user@server xfce4-session
```

Some switches

```
-f Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution. This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background. This implies -n. The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm. 
-C Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections). The compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the ''level'' can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for protocol version 1. Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks. The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration files; see the Compression option. 
```

### Some explanations 

[Xephyr - Multiple nested X sessions ](http://web.archive.org/web/20160520083948/http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/xephyr.html) Actually this is expanded version of the previous Ubuntu forums stuff

 -ac disables access control restrictions and allows you to forward X sessions. This is probably similar to running xhost +, which allows you to accept forwarded X sessions to your own.

- screen <resolution> is the screen size of the forwarded sessions. You can choose anything you want, but it's best to keep it within the limits of your native resolution.

-br sets the background color to black. You can choose others if you want.

-reset -terminate is a sort of a failsafe mechanism that should make sure Xephyr closes automatically after the last X session (client) has been killed.

2> /dev/null redirects any error message to /dev/null, a device that is a sort of a black hole, it eats anything sent to it and never gives back. Think of it as your digital trash bin.

:1 is the display that you are using Xephyr for. In general, the default display is :0, which is your monitor. Any additional display, real or virtual, needs a new port. In this case, we're using :1, but we can also use :3, :17 or anything.

& means Xephyr is going to run in the background. Nothing serious, it will merely relinquish the command of the terminal windows back to you. 



## Script to run Xephyr from xmonad 
From [this page](https://docu.blackdot.be/configuration/xmonad)


**.xmonad/bin/xmonad-xephyr-run**

```bash
#!/bin/sh

if [ "$(ps aux | grep Xephyr | grep -v grep | grep -vi virtualbox | wc -l)" -lt 1 ]; then
	exec Xephyr -screen 1366x752 -terminate -title "Xmonad Classic" :3 &
	xdotool search --classname "Xephyr" windowmove 0 16
	xdotool search --classname "Xephyr" windowsize 1366 752
	sleep 1
	export DISPLAY=:3
	exec xfce4-session
	sleep 1
	exe=`dmenu_run_xephyr -nb black -sb black -nf "#555753" -sf "#8AE234"`
	eval "exec $exe"
else
	export DISPLAY=:3
	exe=`dmenu_run_xephyr -nb black -sb black -nf "#555753" -sf "#8AE234"`
	eval "exec $exe"

fi
```

**.xmonad/bin/xmonad-xephyr-kill**

```bash
#!/bin/sh

PID=$(ps aux | grep Xephyr | grep :3 | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }')

if [ ! -z $PID ]; then
	kill $PID
fi
```

Key binding

```haskell
keys' conf@(XConfig {XMonad.modMask = modMask}) = M.fromList [
     ((modMask,			    xK_p	), bindOn [("3:classic", spawn "/home/sjorge/.xmonad/bin/xmonad-xephyr-run")
```

## Running xmonad inside xnest

[From this discussion](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/xmonad/2007-June/001128.html)

```bash
#!/bin/sh

Xnest :1 -name "Xnest" +kb -ac -bw 5 -geometry 1260x780 &
XNEST_PROC=$!

DISPLAY=:1
xsetroot -display :1 -solid gray

/home/gimbo/xmonad/xmonad/dist/build/xmonad/xmonad

wait $!
kill $XNEST_PROC
```

# Running some applications in xmonad

[Change default fullscreen behavior](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=138703) -- The idea is to look for _NET_WM_FULLSCREEN atom handling. The issue solution is for i3.

## Interesting layouts to possible try

### [Xmonad layouts for netbooks](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/xmonad_layouts_for_netbooks/)

Some interesting ideas from this site

#### Coding layout


```haskell
myCode = limitWindows 3 $ magnifiercz' 1.4 $ FixedColumn 1 20 80 10
```  

**Explanation for FixedColumn**

```haskell
data FixedColumn a = FixedColumn !Int -- Number of windows in the master pane
                                 !Int -- Number to increment by when resizing
                                 !Int -- Default width of master pane
                                 !Int -- Column width for normal windows
                        deriving (Read, Show)
```

**Explanation for magnifiercz'**

[Documentation](http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Layout-Magnifier.html)

```haskell
magnifiercz' :: Rational -> l a -> ModifiedLayout Magnifier l a -- Increase the size of the window that has focus by a custom zoom, unless if it is the master window. 
```
##### Dishes layout

![Image](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/xmonad_layouts_for_netbooks/380x-logs.png)

Something like rotated fixedcolumn: one big panel and many small below

```haskell
myDish = limitWindows 5 $ Dishes nmaster ratio
    where
        -- The default number of windows in the master pane
        nmaster = 1
        -- Default proportion of screen occupied by other panes
        ratio = 1/5
```

## Floating layout

### Review of [Does anyone have a sane floating layout in Xmonad](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=80124)

**Questions addressed**

1. To raise a window I need to hold the mod key and mouse click. I'd like to simply click to raise.
2. If there are more than one instance of a program running, raising one instance raises them all.
3. Switching focus between windows with the keyboard doesn't work with new windows unless it's been raised with the mouse once.


**Suggest xmonad config with possible solution**
